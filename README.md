### Project
We used Exploratory Data Analysis to analyse:
- sum of yields in different districts.
- sum of yields of different crops.
- total annual yield of different crops.
- average yields in different districts.

Using the above information, we have drafted a report of patterns detected and measures to be taken during that time.
